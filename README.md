# Nielsen-Media-Research-DMA
"A Designated Market Area (DMA) is a group of counties in the United States that are covered by a specific group of television stations. The term was coined by Nielsen Media Research, and they control the trademark on it. There are 210 DMAs in the United States" (Wikipedia). Each DMA has a 3 digit numeric code. For example, New York, NY is also known as 501. Los Angeles, CA, on the other hand has been assigned the number 803.
